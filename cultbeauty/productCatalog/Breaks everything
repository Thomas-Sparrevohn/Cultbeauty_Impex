;ORD046;"Buffet" and Copper Peptides 1% ;"<p>Like an opulent feast for the skin, The Ordinary’s beloved ""Buffet"" serum features an impressive array of age-defying wonders – and this enhanced edition also features copper peptides (also known as GHK-Cu/Copper Tripeptide-1). Copper tripeptide GHK-Cu is a skin-supporting peptide found naturally in human plasma, which decreases as skin ages. Forming a foundation for skin health, this peptide complex penetrates the dermis to figure out cell imbalances and help them communicate better, helping out wherever your skin is struggling, improving textural damage, battling blemishes, evening out tone and restoring youthful radiance. Alongside this, ""Buffet"" + Copper Peptides 1% also features age-defying Matrixyl 3000 and other youth-boosting peptide complexes, a nourishing probiotic complex, 11 skin-friendly amino acids and multiple forms of hydrating hyaluronic acid. With regular use, this ultra-smoothing serum will reveal nourished, youthful-looking skin.</p> ";ORD046;
