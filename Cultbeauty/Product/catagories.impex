;ABD;Augustinus Bader;<p>Developed by a world-leading expert in stem cell research, Professor Augustinus Bader has spent thirty years unlocking the body’s innate processes to self-heal. The result? Game-changing skin care that uses a unique, patented Trigger Factor Complex - TFC8 - to help visibly reduce the signs of ageing and damage caused by environmental stressors, and leave skin looking restored, regenerated and glowing.</p><br><br>
;AES;Aesop;<p>Aesop skin care marries botanical ingredients with advanced technology to address the specific concerns of your skin with precision and efficiency. The brand doesn’t believe in ‘anti’ – you won’t see any hyperbolic ‘anti-ageing’ or ‘anti-acne’ claims – instead, the products are developed to complement a balanced lifestyle, and help counteract the impact of the elements. This is ‘pro’ skin care for those who’re planning to grow older gracefully, proud of the skin that they live in. What&#39s more, the bottles are truly iconic, instantly transforming any bathroom into the set of an &#39at home with Vogue&#39 shoot. Absolutely exquisite in every respect!</p><br><br>

;AME;Ameliorate;<p>Born out of one woman&rsquo&#59s frustration, AMELIORATE&rsquo&#59s creator Annette was desperate to transform her &lsquo&#59chicken skin&rsquo&#59 arms. Having suffered from Keratosis Pilaris from an early age &ndash&#59 a remarkably common condition which causes skin to appear rough, red and bumpy due to an excess production of keratin (an essential part of skin&rsquo&#59s uppermost layers) &ndash&#59 which results in the development of little &lsquo&#59plugs&rsquo&#59 or goose bumps, Annette decided to take matters into her own hands. Nothing she tried had lived up to its promises, which is why she set about developing an exfoliating treatment and skin-smoothing body lotion, to gently resurface and intensively condition. Together, they&rsquo&#59re a valuable therapy for sufferers of KP, as well as those who&rsquo&#59re plagued with dry skin conditions &ndash&#59 so liberate your limbs and bare your skin with confidence.</p>

The youth-boosting benefits are miraculous - within a few days of using his Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel you&#39ll see a marked improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, hyper pigmentation, blemishes, scarring and overall radiance… we say &#39Alpha Beta Wanna!&#39</p><br><br>

;UNB;Unbound;<p>Diagnosed with cancer at the age of 21, Women In Sex Tech co-founder and CEO of Unbound, Polly Rodriguez went through radiation treatment that catapulted her into menopause. Cancer and the menopause forced Rodriguez to decide whether she’d carry on fearing her body or learn to appreciate it and, in an effort, to reclaim her body and sexuality she went shopping for a vibrator, but the shopping experience proved incredibly uncomfortable, embarrassing and unfruitful. In contrast, Unbound boasts a strong sex-positive ethos and safe place for women and femmes to freely and comfortably explore their sexuality with its range of female-orientated sex toys, lubricants and more that will definitely have you feelin’ yourself.&nbsp&#59</p><br><br>
;UOM;UOMA BEAUTY;<p>Frustrated by the lack of inclusion and diversity in the beauty industry, make up maven Sharon Chuter created UOMA BEAUTY – the first ‘Afropolitan’ make up brand – with the aim of creating high-quality formulas that are created for everybody from the inception. Advocate for self-love, representation and make up with meaning, Sharon’s ground-breaking range has been formulated to suit a vast number of skin tones and needs – which is why they use an innovative shade identifier known as the Fitzpatrick scale, which measures skin’s reaction to the sun. From this, UOMA BEAUTY have identified six beauty categories depending on undertone, skin chemistry and common issues associated with said skin type, to create an all-inclusive range where everyone can find their ‘Skin Kins’. Modern, powerful and rebellious, this innovative line is the beginning of a long-awaited beauty revolution – and we couldn’t be more ready to join the new frontier…</p><br><br>
;URB;Urban Apothecary;<p>Born out of a desire to layer traditional ingredients – such as flowers, fruits, resins and woods – in unconventional, contemporary ways, Urban Apothecary is a new take on home fragrance that will transform your rooms. Combining distinctive aromas, the candles and diffusers encapsulate mixtures of memories and moods. Whether you choose Smoked Leather, Bay Berry or Green Lavender (to name but a few) this curated collection of truly original scents will inspire, nurture and transport the senses.</p>
;VEN;VENeffect;<p>As women age, our oestrogen levels decline, which also reduces collagen production (boo hiss), causing our skin to lose elasticity – and find fine lines, wrinkles and other tell-tale signs of getting older. The first skin care line to address this specifically, VENeffect is the brainchild of dream sister act Rebecca Booth, M.D. (an acclaimed gynaecologist) and Cecil Booth (a beauty expert with 20 years of industry experience). Together, the sisters crafted a range starring a complex of 100% natural, plant-based ‘phyto-oestrogens’, which mimic the plumping, youth-boosting benefits of oestrogen (safely and effectively) to restore your healthy, vibrant glow – bringing about the brand’s namesake ‘Venus Effect’.</p><br><br><p><br></p><br><br>
;VER;Verso;<p>A brand new dawn in age-defying skin care, Verso have revolutionised the future of retinol with their signature ‘Retinol 8 Complex’. Eight times more effective than typical retinol in the same dosage, this phenomenal range harnesses all the collagen-boosting, wrinkle-plumping, skin-rejuvenating benefits of vitamin A, in a potent concentration in which they have virtually eradicated the risk of irritation. By training cells to mimic the behaviour of younger skin, you (and everyone you know) will quickly see a vast improvement in your skin’s luminosity and texture, as well as a dramatic decrease in the depth and visibility of lines. Named after the latin for ‘reverse’, and housed in exquisite, award-winning packaging, Verso have made anti-ageing as easy as 1, 2, 3, (4, 5).&nbsp&#59</p><br><br>
