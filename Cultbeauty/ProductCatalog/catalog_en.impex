;MOO025;"<p>Achieve peak performance with Moon Juice’s Power Dust – ideal for giving your engine the extra ‘tszuj’ required to help realise your athletic potential. With immunity-boosting astragalus, alongside vitalizing ginseng, organic eleuthero, schisandra (a proven ‘superberry’), rhodiola and organic stevia, this can be added to your morning shake or smoothie, sprinkled over cereal or mixed through your lunchtime grain bowl to kick-start metabolic function, extend your work out and accelerate recovery. It’s also ideal for promoting positivity, reducing inflammation (one of the key causes of ageing), reducing stress levels and balancing hormones to help you be the best version of ‘you’.&nbsp;</p>"
;BOT005;"A thoroughly modern, all-natural range inspired by old African beauty rituals, African Botanics harnesses the skin-replenishing properties of Marula oil – the world’s most antioxidant-rich oil. Founded by Craig and Julia Noik – both originally from South Africa – the couple came across Marula on their travels through their native country, and Julia – having recently given birth – was amazed by the speed with which the oil repaired her ‘stretched’, post-pregnancy skin. In fact, the pair were so impressed by its skin-strengthening performance, they persuaded a South African laboratory to analyse its properties – and were bowled over by the findings. Marula oil has incredibly potent antioxidant stability and stars 78% omega 9 to fortify skin’s fabric, reverse signs of damage and protect against ageing effects of free radicals – which is why it is the cornerstone of this exquisite range of face and body treatments."

The handy travel case adds to the allure, easy to slip into your day bag so you can touch up on-the-go.&nbsp;</p>"

;ZIT001;"<p>One of life’s pimple pleasures, KILLA is a genius spot patch that aims to disrupt a zit before it emerges... Designed for deep, upcoming varieties in their early stages, it has 24 microdarts to allow a potent potion of ingredients to enter and work beneath the skin’s dead skin cell layer. Before you withdraw in horror—these microdarts are so tiny that they don’t hurt, although you may feel a slight (and rather satisfying, might we add) tingling sensation. Once these darts have worked their magic, there are just five ingredients that are called to action: moisture-magnet hyaluronic acid, exfoliating salicylic acid, calming niacinamide, the silencer oligopeptide-76 and pH-balancing sodium hydroxide – notice the lack of parabens, sulphates and other nasties? Three cheers for ZitSticka! Alongside eight KILLA patches, the kit contains eight CLEANA ingredient-soaked swabs which prime your skin so the patch will easily adhere. Once applied, leave these bad boys to do their business without fear of slipping (they’re water-resistant) or drawing attention to the problem (they’re semi-sheer, clear and very discreet).&nbsp;</p>"
;PFL008;"<p>Capturing the ‘essence’ of Morocco, Laboratory Perfumes’ Atlas Eau de Toilette will transport you from the Marrakech medina to the country’s snow-topped peaks. Inspired by the smooth, nostalgic quality of pipe tobacco, Lab’s creators worked with a tobacconist to discover the perfect blend and cure to build their fragrance from – eventually alighting upon one with a whisper of the exotic, reminiscent of North Africa’s historic heart. They introduced supportive layers of warm, velvety rum, sweet vanilla and hay to intensify the scent’s Moroccan character, before lacing it with cinnamon, ginger, black pepper and a splash of cognac to enhance its boozy, sultry signature. Complex and beautifully beguiling, this evolves as the day progresses – revealing new facets to elevate your intrigue.</p>"

;HER032;"<p>Make way for Herbivore’s Bakuchiol Serum, a gel-textured water-based formula that absorbs quickly to brighten, even texture, reduce the appearance of lines and soothe dryness. Giving a wealth of smoothing, brightening and fine line reducing benefits, the serum contains 4% bakuchiol, a natural ingredient derived from the babchi plant.

A 1% polyhydroxy acids blend exfoliates the surface of your skin to gently even texture and minimise fine line, while boosting serum absorption and hydrating. Empowered by tremella mushroom (also known as snow mushroom) extract, this serum infuses your skin with deep hydration and encourages moisture retention to give plump and radiant looking skin. Rich in antioxidants, blueberry stem cells strengthen your skin and protect against environmental aggressors that contribute to premature signs of ageing. Best of all, this natural and vegan serum is suitable for all skin types- even the most sensitive.&nbsp;</p>"

It plumps too – the buffing action combined with coffee arabica seed oil helps to stimulate collagen production, resulting in a smoother, firmer pout.&nbsp;</p>"

;YUR007;"<p>A crucial part of beauty rituals around the world, rose quartz has been used for centuries to repair, de-stress and decongest complexions, thanks to its remarkable healing properties. Often referred to as ‘ice of the gods’, the exquisite powder pink stone is a firm favourite with crystal healers (look away cynics!), who advocate its ability to promote healthy heart and kidney function (circulation and the elimination of toxins are both essential for glowing skin), as well as its positive impact on acne, wrinkles and lymphatic drainage. A symbol of love, the stone promotes optimism and when massaged over the face and neck, it relaxes facial muscles – it's small size is particularly useful for the under-eye area – and gives both skin and emotions a much-needed 'lift'. Use around the eye orbital and you’ll soon see a difference in the texture, tone and clarity. With regular use, your fine lines appear lessened, dark circles diminishes, and you’ll notice a reduction in persistent wrinkles (it’s great for combatting ‘elevens’). Store in the fridge to enhance the relaxing and tightening benefits.&nbsp;You're guaranteed to fall head-over-heels for it.</p>"

Crafted from SHHHOWERCAP’s premium, nano-tech fabric, the cap repels water on a molecular level, meaning it’s not just waterproof, it’s ‘hydrophobic’ – water beads up and slides straight off it. Though it repels water, it’s also breathable, preventing heat and humidity from becoming trapped and ruining your hard-earned hairdo by creating frizz and zapping volume. A rubber grip holds the cap securely in place – without leaving the dreaded indent mark on your forehead – while thick, premium elastic maintains its strength without stretching out and one size fits all hair types and head sizes. Drying immediately, it won’t drip on your bathroom floor, suitcase or gym bag and it’s chic enough to wear at the beach, spa, with a hair mask – or even out in the rain. Like a gorgeously green waterproof turban, The Envy guarantees ultimate shower sophistication in a shade of emerald green. Plus, by investing in one product that lasts, you’ll reduce plastic waste too, so there’s really no excuse not to.</p><p><br></p>"

;LIV013;"<p>Frizz fighting is notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on oils and silicones, to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down, which help to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise an innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered. </p>"

;GHD003;"<p>As good as gold, this ghd gold® styler is a must-have for sleek, smooth and shiny hair – no matter if you like it straight, curly or wavy. Heating up faster than you can say “I’m in love with my ghd’s” (or thereabouts), this incredible tool takes only 25 seconds to be ready for use, making them a godsend for busy bees, rushed mornings and ‘I should have arrived at the party half an hour ago’ occasions. After extensive research, ghd’s scientists concluded that 185ºC is the ideal temperature for styling; cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. To ensure this optimum temperature is always maintained, the plates have been carefully crafted with dual-zone technology – instead of one, they have two heat sensors across each plate that regulate heat from root to tip. These clever floating plates are also ultra-smooth, gliding effortlessly through your tresses to create a frizz-free style with salon-rivalling shine. Great for straightening, curling or creating beachy waves, the tool has a round barrel to deliver snag-free, versatile styles with ease. For peace of mind, the device automatically switches off after 30 minutes and has a heat-resistant protective plate guard so you can take it out and about without risk of burns. With so much to offer, the golden ticket to your best hair yet is well deserved of a spot in your next Cult Beauty haul…&nbsp;</p>"

;LIV025;"<p>Daily shampooing, heat styling, chemical processing, colouring and UV exposure all wreak havoc with hair strength, health and resilience.

Oils and silicones are effective ‘quick fixes’ but only temporarily disguise the underlying damage – which is why Living Proof have developed a targeted range of reparative products, to fortify strands from the inside out. Their innovative silicone and oil-free solutions star the brand’s patented OFPMA – the proprietary technology that coats each individual hair with an ultra-thin, non-greasy shield that smooths, corrects and protects from root-to-tip, whilst re-establishing moisture balance and delivering UV and thermal protection up to 235°C.

It’s been developed in the tradition of French facials that include extraction and works in three steps. Firstly, keratolytic enzymes break down the keratin of dead cells that blocks pores. This allows the white clay – which LIXIRSKIN considers the simplest yet supreme skin saviour – to clear congestion, draw out impurities and reduce excess sebum. Finally, the product dries and turns into a non-abrasive, mechanical exfoliant – the more you ‘rub’, the more dead skin cells will be gone! This triple action leaves your complexion swiftly clearer, purified and smoothed – the texture of your skin is refined and toned, with pores and imperfections far less visible.</p>"

Lack of volume is a direct consequence of super-smooth strands – without ‘texture’, the hairs lie sadly on top of one another, and are determinedly resistant to styling, coaxing and cajoling; typically, without masses of (restrictive) product, fine hair ‘falls out’, which is why Living Proof decided to approach things differently. Unlike many volumising products – that either ‘glue’ hair into position, or strip it of oils so it’s stiff and untouchable – the 'Full’ range is powered by either PBAE; a proprietary technology that mimics the look and feel of thicker hair, by depositing a flexible and virtually indestructible ‘web’ between strands, and OFPMA which not only removes residue to enhance hair’s natural fullness, but helps repel dirt so there’s less need for washing (within reason). </p>"

;LIV007;"<p>Frizz fighting is notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on oils and silicones, to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down, which help to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered.</p>"

;LIV022;"<p>Daily shampooing, heat styling, chemical processing, colouring and UV exposure all wreak havoc with hair strength, health and resilience. Over time, strands become brittle, dry and more susceptible to breakage – which is why we often reach for short-term synthetic cover-ups, which only exacerbate the problem. Oils and silicones are effective ‘quick fixes’ but only temporarily disguise the underlying damage – which is why Living Proof have developed a targeted range of reparative products, to fortify strands from the inside out.

Our skin has native receptors for cannabis extracts, also known as cannabinoids (cannabidiol or 'CBD' and hemp are the best-known examples) making them incredibly bioavailable – which means they’re quickly recognised by the body and utilised accordingly, thanks to an 'ecannabinoid' system that extends to our skin. 2.5% (250mg) full Spectrum CBD hemp oil, this brilliant concoction can be added to face oils, added to coffee or simply placed under your tongue – members of DISCIPLE HQ reportedly take it with a ‘down the hatch’ mentality. Whether you swallow it or use it topically, up to 70% of what your put on your skin ends up in your body, so you know it will work its magic however you use it. After cleansing, combine a couple of drops of <a href=&quothttps://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/disciple-skincare-good-skin-face-oil.html&quot target=&quot_blank&quot>{Good Skin}</a> or <a href=&quothttps://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/disciple-skincare-dreamy-skin-retinyl-oil.html&quot target=&quot_blank&quot>{Dreamy Skin}</a> with two of Miracle Drops.

Allow the oils to sink into your skin and enjoy a relaxing evening and a good night’s sleep. If you suffer from very dry skin you can use a nourishing serum beforehand or layer with a moisturising cream or balm on top.</p>"

;SCH042;"<p>The solution to sensitive, unhappy complexions, Sarah Chapman’s Comfort Cream D-Stress provides both instant relief and long-term benefits to easily stressed skin.

Adding to the formula’s repairing properities, Collageneer® is an active that boosts collagen levels, increasing elasticity and firmness that may have slackened due to age-accelerating free radicals.

;LXR005;"<p>Founder of LIXIRSKIN Colette Haydon (doctor in dermo-pharmacy and the mastermind formulator behind many of your favourite ‘cult’ products) is about to change the way you view skin care. A hero trio in her streamlined, fuss-free and seriously pretty millennial pink range, LIXIRSKIN’s Night Switch formulations are based around the idea that products with too many active ingredients confuse the skin, causing it to work too hard and give up, or become saturated and reach a ‘plateau stage’ where results are no longer delivered. To avoid this, introduce Night Switch PHA/AHA 10% (along with <a href=&quothttps://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/lixirskin-night-switch-retinol-1.html&quot target=&quot_blank&quot>{Night Switch Retinol 1%}</a> and <a href=&quothttps://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/lixirskin-night-switch-bhaaha-10.html&quot target=&quot_blank&quot>{Night Switch BHA/AHA 10%}</a>) into your regime. With a blend of three acids, this intelligent blend exfoliates and dislodges dead, dulling skin cells, reducing pigmentation and encouraging cell turnaround. Each acid offers a special benefit: lactic improves hydration, lactobionic reduces oxidative stress and phytic eliminates heavy metals to detoxify the skin. Ideal mixed with LIXIRSKIN’s <a href=&quothttps://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/lixirskin-universal-emulsion.html&quot target=&quot_blank&quot>{Universal Emulsion}</a>, this will quickly leave your skin even-toned, radiant, plumper and softer, as well as minimising fine lines, pores and imperfections such as age spots over time.

;ORD050;"<p>An innovative take on sunscreen that does so much more than guard your complexion against the harmful, ageing effects of the sun (though it does that very well indeed) The Ordinary’s Mineral UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants offers unrivalled protection. Avoiding the use of nanoparticles (these are small enough to penetrate your skin and get inside your body), The Ordinary has formulated this sunscreen with ultra-refined zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, suspended within non-comedogenic (non-pore-blocking) silicones. This allows the formula to remain extremely lightweight and prevent it from over-burdening your skin. An advanced antioxidant complex scavenges and neutralises free radicals, minimizes the intensity of UV radiation penetrating the skin, while a bio-sugar complex provides both short and long-term hydration and also naturally increases skin’s own capacity to hold water. Finally, Tasmanian pepperberry helps to calm stressed skin for a soothed finish.&nbsp;</p>"

Alongside these, whole carrot cells (rich in water and nutrients) deliver hydration for skin that looks healthy and full of moisture.&nbsp;</p>"

;FSI003;"<p>There’s only one secret behind Farsáli’s Volcanic Elixir – the oil extracted from the nut kernels of tamanu fruit, which flourishes in the south Pacific islands of Polynesia thanks to its fertile volcanic atmosphere. Due to the nutrients and minerals from volcanic ash, the tamanu oil that powers this precious elixir contains an ultra-high natural nutritional value, making it an extraordinary skin regenerator. Conditioning broken skin, repairing sun damage and addressing acne damage are just a few of its super powers; it also boasts serious anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibiotic and antioxidant benefits, making it ideal for acne sufferers. With an all-natural, earthy aroma, it makes the perfect addition to any night-time routine – you’ll wake up to ridiculously good results.</p><p><br></p><p>*Please note that in cold temperatures, this product may become partly solidified. This is perfectly normal, does not affect the efficacy of the product and is due, in part, to the high-grade, unrefined purity of the ingredients (especially the tamanu oil and virgin coconut oil). In order to avoid this, however, try to keep the oil at room temperature or warmer and if it has part solidified, try standing it in hot water for a few minutes to warm the oil up.</p>"
;GHD006;"<p>Ideal for long, thick or curly tresses, the ghd max styler has all the mane-changing benefits of the cult-adored original styler but with larger 2 inch plates. These smooth floating plates have been designed with ghd’s advanced ceramic heat technology, allowing a consistent temperature of 185ºC to be maintained for optimal styling – cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. The result? Smoother, healthier, frizz-free locks with salon-quality shine. The clever features don’t end there: a rounded barrel allows for effortless snag-free styling, particularly when creating curls, while a ultra-speedy 30 second heat up time makes it a godsend on rushed mornings. It takes safety very seriously indeed too with a travel-friendly heat resistant protective plate guard and (best of all) an automatic sleep mode that switches the device off after 30 minutes – welcome relief for those heart-wrenching ‘did I leave my straighteners on’ moments.&nbsp;</p>"

;ORD024;"<p>Featuring two of the most renowned, powerful antioxidants used in skin care, The Ordinary’s Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% is a highly concentrated method for defending against free radicals and defying signs of ageing. Produced by some plants to protect them against environmental stressors, the resveratrol in this formulation is 100% derived from Japanese knotweed, while ferulic acid comes from the cell walls of plants (such as oats and the seeds of apples) where it plays a key role in protection and self-preservation. Traditional formulations tend to incorporate resveratrol at 1% and ferulic acid at 0.5%, whereas this unique fluid features an exceptionally high (3%) concentration (and no water, silicones, oils or alcohol) to maximise the age-defying effects. The key benefit of these two potent ingredients is their ability to neutralise free radicals, therefore preventing the production of collagen and elastin from being inhibited (which will keep skin plumper and more youthful).

;ORD040;"<p>Alpha hydroxy acids are a well-established skin care hero. Ingredients such a glycolic, lactic and malic acid are renowned for their ability to dissolve the skin’s dulling ‘stratum corneum’ (the oldest, thinnest, top layer of skin) and reveal the younger, more radiant cells beneath. However, these potent acids can irritate skin, especially sensitive complexions – and that’s where The Ordinary’s Mandelic Acid 10% + HA comes in. This innovative formulation offers superficial dermal peeling (that’s exfoliation to you and me) that is gentler than other alpha hydroxy acid formulations. How is it gentler, you ask? Simple – the molecular weight of mandelic acid is larger than that of other alpha hydroxy acids and this larger size means that it penetrates the skin more slowly. This makes for a milder exfoliating experience that will suit even the most sensitive complexions, leaving skin smoother, more even and gorgeously glowing. The Ordinary’s (characteristically ingenious) formulation also includes hyaluronic acid, to hydrate and comfort skin while plumping away the look of fine lines.

Powerfully purifying, this gentle creamy cleanser eliminates every last trace of make up and grime, while counteracting the ravages wrought by everyday exposure to pollutants and the elements.

;RJU001;"Collagen is effectively the ‘fabric’ of the skin – interwoven strands, which provide skin strength, elasticity and structure but sadly (like mum’s Laura Ashley sofa) – gradually show signs of wear and tear. Collagen synthesis starts to slow down at around age 25 (eeeeek!!!) and reports show that by the time you hit  45, collagen levels have fallen by as much as 30%  – which is when those creases really start to make themselves at home. So ‘three cheers’ for Rejuvenated Ltd.’s Collagen Shots, which have been proven to bolster collagen levels and in turn, repair fraying fabric to restore skin’s pliability and thickness, and counteract sagging, dehydration, crêpiness and wrinkling.

Whatever your age, this fabulous formula will make your skin appear brighter and smoother – it blurs away blemishes, cancels shadows, corrects colour and minimises the appearance of ageing, making it perfect as a base for make up or a standalone base, imparting an oh-so subtle pearlescent glow.

;DAK002;"Unlike creams or moisturisers, Sonya Dakar’s weightless Retinu serum is able to penetrate deep within skin where it ‘irritates’ cells into action. As we grow older, our skin’s production line slows down – cells manufacture essential ‘scaffolding’ such as elastin and collagen more slowly – which is where retinol comes to the fore. Like a parent who insists you ‘GET OUT OF BED!’, the vitamin A-derivative renews cells’ vigour so they behave like much younger versions of themselves. Skin texture is refined and tone becomes more even – and because the retinol is naturally-derived, the skin-renewal process is extremely gentle, so you won’t encounter any all-too common dryness, redness or unsightly flaking."

This can include repairing stress-damaged tissue while speeding up cell renewal and creating barriers to counter the damage of UV rays.

;REN020;"<p>REN CLEAN SKINCARE’s Micro Polish Cleanser is a two-in-one formula that deep cleans and gently exfoliates, eliminating dulling dead skin cells and refining skin texture to minimise congestion and reduce the risk of breakouts. Papain – a Papaya derived enzyme – and Glycolic Acid team up to dissolve the bonds that trap dead cells and residue to skin’s surface, while tiny amber beads physically ‘polish’ your complexion, to leave your face feeling refreshed and looking smooth, ‘plump’ and luminous. Fine lines gradually appear less visible – Glycolic Acid stimulates collagen synthesis to ‘plump’ and fortify at a cellular level – so skin looks younger, with fewer blocked pores and a healthy, radiant glow.</p>"

The heart of fresh soft rose evolves to a multi-faceted, mellow base of Javanol and Polysantol (a slightly sweeter sandalwood molecule), which whisper in sync with pink grapefruit, pink pepper, hedione, Iso E Super, abroxan (synthetic ambergris), vetiver and the distinctive, herbal tang of marijuana. You’ll ooze sophistication when you’re dressed in this seductive, mellow veil of woody ‘otherness’… just make sure that your partner buys their own.</p>"

;LIV010;"<p>Frizz-smoothing is a notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on silicones to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down, which helps to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered. Also in the Instant De-Frizzer is a clever blend of oils which replicate the functions of those found naturally in the hair, plus conditioning agents to soften and seal the cuticle. The result? Sleek, smooth and frizz-free locks. </p>"

In terms of effects, how do you like the sound of defence from free radical damage, even, radiant skin tone and diminished signs of ageing? Pretty difficult to resist!

Unlike many volumising products – that either ‘glue’ hair into position, or strip it of oils so it’s stiff and untouchable – Full Thickening Cream is powered by the brand's patented Thickening Molecule (PBAE); a proprietary technology that mimics the look and feel of thicker hair, by depositing a flexible and virtually indestructible ‘web’ between strands. Hair feels soft and naturally fuller – and you can comb, style and run your fingers through it, without any risk of deflation.</p>"

;SHI034;"<p>Scented with a blend of roses, cherry and plum blossoms, this rich creamy foaming cleanser gently purges pores of impurities while maintaining your skin’s natural moisture levels, leaving your complexion feeling soft, smooth and fresh – never tight and dry. By thoroughly cleansing your skin without stripping it, this cleanser prepares skin perfectly for the next steps in your regime, allowing it to efficiently absorb the benefits of subsequent treatments. The star ingredient in Shiseido’s Future Solution range is Skingenecell 1P, a patented synthetic amino acid that’s been proven– in Shiseido’s in-house studies – to significantly reduce the amount of serpin B3 in skin. When serpin B3 is reduced, the skin restores its own moisture levels and feels smoother, defying signs of ageing as it goes. Skingenecell 1P is combined with enmei extract – a herb discovered at Mt. Koya, Japan – which is revered for its health-boosting, youth-prolonging benefits. Your complexion will be left looking (and feeling!) soft, supple and glowing with youthful radiance.</p>"

To protect against premature ageing at the hands of environmental aggressors, ginseng extract supports the skin’s own defences against free radicals.

Visibly brighter and more even skin with reduced signs of ageing with continued use.&nbsp;</p>"

It’s especially recommended for dry and combination skin types.</p>"
;LIV011;"<p>Frizz fighting is notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on oils and silicones, to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down, which help to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered.</p>"

;GLD055;"<p>The ultimate power pair, Goldfaden MD’s Doctor's Scrub and Bright Eyes Duo is the perfect addition to any skin care ritual. The ‘hero’ of Goldfaden MD’s range, Doctor’s Scrub is a thick paste that’s brimming with resurfacing ruby crystals – perfectly spherical to eradicate dulling dead cells without damaging delicate skin. The tiny grains are phenomenally effective – abrasive but non-irritating – while the formula is rich in line-plumping hyaluronic acid, nourishing seaweed and organic red tea extracts to promote moisture levels and neutralise the skin-ageing effects of free radicals. Ultra-lightweight, Bright Eyes has a refreshing formula that’s packed with actives to help fortify the fabric of the fragile skin around the eyes. Conditioning jojoba oil works to replenish precious moisture and enhance skin’s suppleness and ‘stretch’, while vitamin K, rice bran extract, organic red tea and soy peptides combine to provide sustained hydration and counteract crêpey-ness.

;INK001;"<p>Naturally found in our skin to maintain hydration levels, hyaluronic acid is a skin care superstar for a reason. Essentially a ‘moisture magnet’, it attracts moisture from the atmosphere and can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. Over time, our hyaluronic acid levels decrease (sob) resulting in dullness, fine lines and uneven tone and texture. The perfect foil for this unfortunate state of affairs, THE INKEY LIST’s gentle Hyaluronic Acid Serum stars the stuff at a pure, 2% concentration and in three molecular weights (high, medium and low) to ensure maximum absorption at every layer of your skin. Dehydrated skin affects most of us (even oily skin can be dehydrated) and, differing from dryness, results from a lack of water in the skin. Replenish this water with The Inkey List’s high-quality, impressively affordable formula and you can expect plumper, healthier skin, with fewer visible fine lines and wrinkles and a more even tone and texture. It can even aid the efficacy of products applied after it – genius.&nbsp;</p>"

Though it repels water, it’s also breathable, preventing heat and humidity from becoming trapped and ruining your hard-earned hairdo by creating frizz and zapping volume. A rubber grip holds the cap securely in place – without leaving the dreaded indent mark on your forehead – while thick, premium elastic maintains its strength without stretching out and one size fits all hair types and head sizes. Drying immediately, it won’t drip on your bathroom floor, suitcase or gym bag and it’s chic enough to wear at the beach, spa, with a hair mask – or even out in the rain. Specially selected by SHHHOWERCAP’s online fans, The Not Basic guarantees ultimate shower sophistication in a shade of magenta burgundy. Plus, by investing in one product that lasts, you’ll reduce plastic waste too, so there’s really no excuse not to.</p><p><br></p>"

The addition of very light silicones means that this formulation feels gorgeously smooth on the skin, although a strong (but non-irritating) sensation can be expected during the first 1-2 weeks of use until the skin’s tolerance to a high concentration of vitamin C is improved (the formula can be mixed with other creams and serums to reduce this sensation if needed). Ideally applied at night, this fabulous formula works hard while you do the opposite, leaving you with smooth, bright and even skin when morning comes around.</p>"

;LEG007;"<p>If your legs feel heavy, swollen, tired, tight – or you just can’t shift stubborn cellulite, it’s time you introduced them to the brand changing the game when it comes to leg care: Legology. Truly innovative, this range was created by award-winning beauty journalist and ‘legspert’ Kate Shapland to provide powerful relief with products that are a joy to use, not a chore. Letting your pins take centre stage, Hot Legs Instant Transformation Kit for Legs is a dreamy, dynamic duo that combines the brand’s Air-Lite Daily Lift For Legs and Sun-Lite Sheer Lingerie For Legs. The former is a pioneering contouring and lightening cream delivers deep drainage benefits to reduce the tightness and puffiness caused by fluid retention, which is especially noticeable if you’re pregnant, flying or spending long days on your feet. By lightening legs and restoring a forgotten nimbleness, the cream also discourages cellulite and dissolves aches, pains and fatigue. At the same time, Air-Lite enhances skin tone, hydration and suppleness, rejuvenating and energising from the toes up. Sun-Lite, meanwhile, is a cool, subtly tinted cream infused with a hint of pearl to give skin ‘un tocco del sole’ (‘a touch of sun’) and scented with Legology’s luscious lemon signature fragrance, Capri Crush.

;LIV012;"<p>Living Proof’s No Frizz Nourishing Oil hydrates and protects even criminally coarse hair to leave it smoother and more manageable. Specially crafted by a crack team of hair heroes, the formula contains a fatty acid combination that closely mimics those found in naturally healthy hair – plus the optimal blend of nourishing oils to give a supercharged moisture boost. This powerful elixir makes dry hair feel soft, shiny and smooth without weighing it down. Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered.</p>"

;TPV003;"<p>A must-have for in-between waxing, laser treatments or dates with the razor, this luxurious formula melts into delicate skin, leaving it moisturised, soft and soothed. Salicylic acid gently exfoliates and works to prevent (and liberate!) ingrown hairs while calming inflammation (take <em>that</em> red bumps!); avena strigosa (black oats) and lecithin then boost water levels to keep the skin soft and hydrated. It’s also enriched with niacinamide - a highly effective skin-restoring ingredient that helps to strengthen and fade any redness or scarring (we've all fallen foul of the odd tweezer gouge as we fish for a pube that refuses to move!) and, if you're (rightfully!) proud of your shrubbery, this keeps your curls ultra-soft and conditioned.</p>"

Gentler than other AHAs, lactic acid has moisturising properties to keep skin smooth and soft – plus, it’s enhanced with 1% hyaluronic acid (this is a low molecular weight to allow it to penetrate skin and provide hydration below the surface). Try this to achieve brighter, more even skin with the appearance of wrinkles reduced.&nbsp;</p>"

When serpin B3 is reduced, the skin restores its own moisture levels and feels smoother, defying signs of ageing as it goes. Skingenecell 1P is combined with enmei extract – a herb discovered at Mt. Koya, Japan – which is revered for its health-boosting, youth-prolonging benefits. This formulation contains the highest concentration possible of this exclusive ‘SkingenecellEnmei’, alongside Japanese botanicals (uji green tea extract, oshima sakura leaf extract and hokkaido angelica root extract) to renew vitality and support long-lasting moisture.</p>"

Also starring pumpkin ferment and pomegranate extracts, the serum enzymatically dissolves dead surface skin cells for a smoother-than-smooth texture. Finally, a sodium hyaluronate cross-polymer quickly penetrates skin and provides intense hydration. The result? A noticeably brighter, more radiant complexion, with signs of ageing and photo damage minimised. The airtight (and cute!) container also helps the formula to stay super-fresh.</p>"
