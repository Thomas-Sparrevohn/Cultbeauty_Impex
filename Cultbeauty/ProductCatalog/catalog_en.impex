;LIV013;No Frizz Shampoo;<p>Frizz fighting is notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on oils and silicones&#44 to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down&#44 which help to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors&#59 when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness&#44 the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre&#44 causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another&#44 the increase in friction results in frizz&#44 so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise an innovative anti-frizz breakthrough&#59 OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones&#44 so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft.

;TWE022;Blackhead Extractor;<p>Show blackheads who’s boss with this dermatologist-tested extraction tool by Tweezerman.

;LIV007;No Frizz Conditioner;<p>Frizz fighting is notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on oils and silicones&#44 to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down&#44 which help to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors&#59 when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness&#44 the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre&#44 causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another&#44 the increase in friction results in frizz&#44 so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough&#59 OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones&#44 so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture&#44 so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered.</p>;

;KSV015;ExfoliKate Introductory Kit;<p>The perfect place to start if you’re just getting acquainted with Kate Somerville (or if you can’t go anywhere without this sought-after skin care range) the ExfoliKate Introductory Kit stars cleanser&#44 treatment and moisturiser from one of the brand’s best-loved ranges. ExfoliKate began with ‘The Hollywood 2-minute facial’&#44 a dual-action exfoliator&#44 before extending with a foaming facial cleanser and a glow-giving moisturiser. Each of these exfoliates away dulling&#44 uneven cells to diminish dryness and reveal unrivalled radiance. How does it reap such miraculous results&#44 you might well ask? It’s all down to gently exfoliating ingredients&#44 including a duo of alpha hydroxy acids – glycolic and lactic acids – and Kate’s ‘three Ps for perfect skin’: pineapple&#44 pumpkin and papaya enzymes. These advanced additions work to counteract dullness&#44 dryness and address uneven skin tone and texture by loosening and sloughing away dead&#44 dulling cells to reveal the beautifully balanced&#44 even radiance beneath. While the cleanser and treatment remove excess oil&#44 make up and surface impurities&#44 Glow Moisturizer will leave your skin softer&#44 smoother and gorgeously glowing in as little as one use.</p>;

;ORD040;Mandelic Acid 10% + HA;<p>Alpha hydroxy acids are a well-established skin care hero. Ingredients such a glycolic&#44 lactic and malic acid are renowned for their ability to dissolve the skin’s dulling ‘stratum corneum’ (the oldest&#44 thinnest&#44 top layer of skin) and reveal the younger&#44 more radiant cells beneath. However&#44 these potent acids can irritate skin&#44 especially sensitive complexions – and that’s where The Ordinary’s Mandelic Acid 10% + HA comes in. This innovative formulation offers superficial dermal peeling (that’s exfoliation to you and me) that is gentler than other alpha hydroxy acid formulations. How is it gentler&#44 you ask? Simple – the molecular weight of mandelic acid is larger than that of other alpha hydroxy acids and this larger size means that it penetrates the skin more slowly. This makes for a milder exfoliating experience that will suit even the most sensitive complexions&#44 leaving skin smoother&#44 more even and gorgeously glowing.

Their innovative silicone and oil-free solutions star the brand’s patented OFPMA – the proprietary technology that coats each individual hair with an ultra-thin&#44 non-greasy shield that smooths&#44 corrects and protects from root-to-tip&#44 whilst re-establishing moisture balance and delivering UV and thermal protection up to 235°C.

This can include repairing stress-damaged tissue while speeding up cell renewal and creating barriers to counter the damage of UV rays. The end result: skin is firm and toned with a radiant glow.</p><br><br>;

A hero trio in her streamlined&#44 fuss-free and seriously pretty millennial pink range&#44 LIXIRSKIN’s Night Switch formulations are based around the idea that products with too many active ingredients confuse the skin&#44 causing it to work too hard and give up&#44 or become saturated and reach a ‘plateau stage’ where results are no longer delivered.

Powered by retinol&#44 this formulation regulates the skin metabolism in both the top and deeper layers.

;LIV010;No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer;<p>Frizz-smoothing is a notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on silicones to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down&#44 which helps to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors&#59 when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness&#44 the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre&#44 causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another&#44 the increase in friction results in frizz&#44 so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough&#59 OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones&#44 so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture&#44 so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered. Also in the Instant De-Frizzer is a clever blend of oils which replicate the functions of those found naturally in the hair&#44 plus conditioning agents to soften and seal the cuticle. The result? Sleek&#44 smooth and frizz-free locks. </p>;

In terms of effects&#44 how do you like the sound of defence from free radical damage&#44 even&#44 radiant skin tone and diminished signs of ageing? Pretty difficult to resist! Just a few drops morning and night and you’re good to go.</p>;

;BYT096;Hydra-Éclat Rich Care;<p>BY TERRY’s Hydra-Éclat Rich Care is a rich&#44 daily comforting balm that addresses dullness and penetrates the epidermis to repair&#44 refresh and reinstate radiance&#44 even on dry&#44 asphyxiated skin types.

It’s especially recommended for dry and combination skin types.</p>;
;LIV011;No Frizz Leave-In Conditioner;<p>Frizz fighting is notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on oils and silicones&#44 to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down&#44 which help to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors&#59 when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness&#44 the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre&#44 causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another&#44 the increase in friction results in frizz&#44 so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough&#59 OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones&#44 so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture&#44 so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered.</p>;

;RJU005;Veggiecol;<p>Collagen is effectively the ‘fabric’ of the skin – interwoven strands&#44 which provide skin strength&#44 elasticity and structure but sadly (like mum’s Laura Ashley sofa) – gradually show signs of wear and tear.

So ‘three cheers’ for Rejuvenated Ltd.’s Veggiecol&#44 the vegetarian alternative to the brand’s adored Collagen Shots.

;LVE001;The Pelvic Floor Trainer;<p>There’s a reason why experts and health authorities across the world recommend Elvie to women with pelvic floor problems – it’s a hi-tech&#44 comfortable and results-driven device that ensures women make the most of their pelvic floor exercises.

The bulb of the tracker features force and motion sensors to measure the movement of your muscles as they contract and release. This is inserted into the vagina with the tail remaining outside and facing forwards (a little like a tampon)&#44 then via Bluetooth it connects to an app on your phone that will guide you through a series of five-minute workouts – from target hitting to strength exercises. There are four different levels to try – Training&#44 Beginner&#44 Intermediate and Advanced – all of which have been carefully designed with the help of physiotherapists and experts. The app also allows you to track your progress&#44 set yourself targets and schedule reminders – plus it’s fun&#44 so it’ll help you to stay motivated! Incredibly discreet&#44 the device comes in a sleek carry case that doubles up as a charger so you can pop it in your on-the-go bag for use anytime&#44 anywhere. 100% waterproof&#44 the trainer is made with medical grade silicone making it incredibly durable and safe.&nbsp&#59</p>;

Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough&#59 OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones&#44 so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture&#44 so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered.</p>;
